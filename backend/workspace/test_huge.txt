Data science is an interdisciplinary field that combines statistics, computer science, and domain expertise to extract meaningful insights from data. The field emerged in the early 2000s as organizations recognized the value of analyzing large datasets to inform business decisions. Data scientists use various tools and techniques to collect, clean, analyze, and visualize data from diverse sources. The data science lifecycle includes problem definition, data collection, exploration, preparation, modeling, evaluation, and deployment stages. Big data refers to datasets that are too large or complex for traditional data processing tools to handle efficiently. The three Vs of big data are volume (amount of data), velocity (speed of data generation), and variety (types of data). Data warehouses centralize data from multiple sources into a single repository for analysis and reporting. Data lakes store raw data in its native format, allowing for flexible analysis and exploration. Structured data is organized in tables with predefined schemas, while unstructured data lacks a fixed structure. Semi-structured data like JSON and XML has some organizational properties but not as rigid as relational databases. Relational databases organize data into tables with rows and columns, connected through relationships and keys. NoSQL databases provide flexible schemas for storing unstructured and semi-structured data at scale. Time series data consists of observations recorded at regular intervals over time, such as stock prices or weather measurements. Spatial data includes geographic information and coordinates for location-based analysis. Categorical data represents discrete categories or groups, while numerical data represents quantities or measurements. Continuous variables can take any value within a range, while discrete variables have specific possible values. Outliers are extreme values that differ significantly from the rest of the data and can skew analysis results. Missing values occur when data points are not recorded and must be handled appropriately during analysis. Data imputation fills missing values using techniques like mean, median, or more sophisticated predictive methods. Data normalization scales numerical features to a common range to prevent features with larger scales from dominating analysis. Standardization transforms data to have a mean of zero and standard deviation of one. Categorical encoding converts categorical variables into numerical representations suitable for machine learning models. One-hot encoding creates binary columns for each category, useful for algorithms that work with numerical data. Label encoding assigns integer values to categories, suitable for ordinal variables with natural ordering. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) involves investigating datasets to discover patterns, anomalies, and relationships. Descriptive statistics summarize data using measures like mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and quartiles. Inferential statistics uses sample data to make conclusions about larger populations. Hypothesis testing determines whether observed differences are statistically significant or due to chance. P-values indicate the probability of observing data as extreme as what was found if the null hypothesis is true. Confidence intervals provide ranges of values likely to contain the true population parameter. Correlation measures the linear relationship between two variables, ranging from -1 to 1. Causation implies that one variable directly influences another, which is different from correlation. Confounding variables create spurious correlations by influencing both variables being compared. Simpson's paradox occurs when trends reverse when data is aggregated versus disaggregated. Data visualization uses charts, graphs, and other visual representations to communicate insights clearly. Histograms display the distribution of numerical data across bins. Scatter plots show relationships between two numerical variables. Box plots visualize the distribution, quartiles, and outliers of data. Heatmaps use color intensity to represent values in a matrix format. Network diagrams show relationships and connections between entities. Time series plots track how values change over time. Dashboards combine multiple visualizations to provide comprehensive views of key metrics. Interactive visualizations allow users to explore data dynamically with filters and drill-down capabilities. Data storytelling combines data visualization with narrative to communicate insights effectively. Regression analysis models the relationship between dependent and independent variables. Linear regression fits a straight line to data to predict continuous outcomes. Multiple regression uses multiple independent variables to predict a single dependent variable. Polynomial regression fits higher-order curves to capture non-linear relationships. Logistic regression predicts binary outcomes using a sigmoid function. Ridge regression and lasso regression add regularization to prevent overfitting. Elastic net combines ridge and lasso regularization for balanced feature selection. Classification assigns observations to predefined categories or classes. Decision trees create hierarchical rules for classification through recursive splitting. Random forests combine multiple decision trees for improved accuracy and robustness. Support vector machines find optimal boundaries between classes in high-dimensional spaces. Naive Bayes uses probability theory to classify data based on feature independence assumptions. K-nearest neighbors classifies points based on the majority class of their nearest neighbors. Gradient boosting sequentially improves predictions by correcting previous model errors. XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost are optimized implementations of gradient boosting. Clustering groups similar observations without predefined labels. K-means clustering partitions data into k clusters by minimizing within-cluster variance. Hierarchical clustering creates tree-like structures showing relationships between clusters. Density-based clustering identifies clusters of arbitrary shapes based on data density. DBSCAN finds clusters of arbitrary shapes and identifies outliers as noise points. Gaussian mixture models assume data comes from multiple Gaussian distributions. Dimensionality reduction reduces the number of features while preserving important information. Principal component analysis (PCA) creates uncorrelated components capturing maximum variance. T-SNE visualizes high-dimensional data in two or three dimensions for exploration. UMAP provides another dimensionality reduction technique useful for visualization. Feature selection identifies the most important features for modeling. Filter methods select features based on statistical properties independent of the model. Wrapper methods evaluate feature subsets using model performance. Embedded methods incorporate feature selection into the model training process. Recursive feature elimination systematically removes features and evaluates model performance. Feature importance scores from tree-based models indicate which features are most valuable. Natural language processing (NLP) analyzes and processes human language. Tokenization breaks text into words or phrases for analysis. Stemming reduces words to their root form, such as "running" to "run". Lemmatization reduces words to dictionary form while considering context. Stop words are common words like "the" and "and" often removed during preprocessing. Bag of words represents text as counts of word occurrences, ignoring order. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) weights words by importance in documents. Word embeddings like Word2Vec represent words as dense vectors capturing semantic relationships. Named entity recognition identifies and classifies entities like people, organizations, and locations. Sentiment analysis determines emotional tone in text as positive, negative, or neutral. Topic modeling discovers abstract topics within document collections. Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) is a probabilistic model for topic discovery. Computer vision analyzes and interprets images and videos. Image classification assigns images to predefined categories. Object detection identifies and locates objects within images. Semantic segmentation assigns class labels to each pixel in an image. Instance segmentation identifies and outlines individual objects in images. Face recognition identifies individuals from facial features in images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are specialized for processing image data. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) process sequential data like time series and text. Long short-term memory (LSTM) networks handle long-term dependencies in sequences. Attention mechanisms allow models to focus on relevant parts of input. Transformers use self-attention to process sequences in parallel, enabling efficient training. Deep learning uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations. Neural networks consist of interconnected nodes organized in layers. Activation functions introduce non-linearity, enabling networks to learn complex patterns. ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is a popular activation function for hidden layers. Sigmoid and softmax activation functions output probabilities for classification. Backpropagation computes gradients for training neural networks through the chain rule. Gradient descent iteratively updates model parameters to minimize loss. Stochastic gradient descent updates parameters using individual samples for faster convergence. Batch gradient descent uses all samples for each update, providing stable but slower convergence. Mini-batch gradient descent balances between stochastic and batch approaches. Learning rate controls the step size for parameter updates during training. Momentum accelerates gradient descent by accumulating gradients over time. Adam optimizer adapts learning rates per parameter, combining momentum and adaptive methods. Dropout randomly deactivates neurons during training to prevent overfitting. Batch normalization standardizes layer inputs, improving training stability and speed. Weight decay adds regularization to penalize large parameter values. Early stopping halts training when validation performance stops improving. Cross-validation assesses model generalization by training on multiple data splits. K-fold cross-validation divides data into k equal parts for evaluation. Stratified cross-validation maintains class proportions in each fold. Leave-one-out cross-validation uses all but one sample for training. Hyperparameter tuning optimizes model configuration settings. Grid search exhaustively evaluates all combinations of hyperparameters. Random search samples random hyperparameter combinations. Bayesian optimization uses probabilistic models to guide hyperparameter search. Model evaluation metrics depend on the specific problem and objectives. Accuracy measures the proportion of correct predictions overall. Precision measures correct positive predictions out of all positive predictions. Recall measures correct positive predictions out of all actual positives. F1 score balances precision and recall with equal weighting. ROC curves visualize trade-offs between true positive and false positive rates. Area under the ROC curve (AUC) summarizes classifier performance with a single value. Confusion matrices display true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. Mean absolute error (MAE) measures average absolute differences between predictions and actuals. Mean squared error (MSE) penalizes larger errors more heavily than smaller ones. Root mean squared error (RMSE) is the square root of MSE in original units. R-squared measures the proportion of variance explained by a regression model. Adjusted R-squared accounts for the number of features to prevent overfitting penalties. Model validation ensures models generalize well to new, unseen data. Training data is used to fit model parameters. Validation data evaluates hyperparameter choices during development. Test data provides an unbiased assessment of final model performance. Data leakage occurs when information from outside the training set influences model training. Temporal leakage happens when future information is inadvertently used to predict past events. Target leakage occurs when features directly derived from the target are included. Ensemble methods combine multiple models to improve predictions. Bagging trains models on different data samples with replacement. Boosting sequentially trains models that correct previous errors. Stacking trains a meta-model on predictions from base models. Voting combines predictions through majority vote or averaging. Model interpretability explains how models make predictions. Feature importance scores indicate which features most influence predictions. Partial dependence plots show how predictions change with feature values. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values quantify each feature's contribution to predictions. LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations) approximates models locally for interpretability. Fairness in data science ensures models treat all groups equitably. Bias in machine learning can arise from biased training data or flawed algorithms. Fairness metrics assess whether models produce disparate impacts across groups. Algorithmic transparency makes model decisions understandable to stakeholders. Model monitoring tracks performance in production to detect degradation. Data drift occurs when input data distribution changes over time. Label drift occurs when the target variable distribution changes. Concept drift occurs when relationships between features and targets change. Retraining updates models as new data becomes available. A/B testing compares model versions by randomly assigning users to each. Recommendation systems suggest items users might prefer. Collaborative filtering recommends items based on similar users' preferences. Content-based filtering recommends items similar to those users previously liked. Matrix factorization decomposes user-item matrices into lower-rank factors. Anomaly detection identifies unusual or suspicious observations. Statistical methods identify points deviating from expected distributions. Isolation forests isolate anomalies using random partitioning.

Propensity score matching creates comparable treatment and control groups. Difference-in-differences compares changes over time between groups. Instrumental variables address confounding through proxy variables. Experiment design determines sample sizes, randomization, and statistical power. Statistical power is the probability of detecting true effects. Type I errors occur when null hypotheses are incorrectly rejected. Type II errors occur when null hypotheses are incorrectly accepted. Effect size measures the magnitude of differences or relationships. Sample size calculations determine how many observations are needed. Bayesian experimental design optimizes information gain per observation. Data ethics addresses responsible data use and privacy.
