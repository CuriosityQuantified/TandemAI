Goal: Identify actual announced applications, distinguish from theoretical potential, and assess evidence quality. Focus areas: 1) Major announcements from pharma/tech companies (2024), 2) Specific drug discovery use cases (protein folding, molecular simulation, drug screening), 3) Partnerships between quantum computing firms and pharmaceutical companies, 4) Published results vs. speculative claims, 5) Technical capabilities demonstrated. Success criteria: Distinguish proven applications from theoretical potential, flag speculative vs. verified claims, identify knowledge gaps, note source limitations for emerging area.",
