Context: Technical evaluation requiring identification of top 3 quantum platforms by qubit count and error rates. Goal: Compile quantitative benchmarks (qubit count, coherence time, gate fidelity) from IBM, Google, IonQ and competitors. Focus areas: 1) Hardware specifications with exact metrics (qubit counts, T1/T2 coherence times, 1-qubit/2-qubit gate fidelities), 2) Error correction breakthroughs and implementations in 2024-2025, 3) Commercial availability (cloud access, pricing models, enterprise programs). Success criteria: Minimum 3 peer-reviewed sources per focus area, quantitative data required for all platforms, cross-reference industry announcements with academic publications. Constraints: Prioritize Nature/Science/IEEE journals, official announcements from IBM/Google/IonQ/Rigetti/Amazon Braket, timeframe 2024-2025 only.",
