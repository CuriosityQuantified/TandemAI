  "steps": [
    "Step 1: Researcher identifies and compiles renewable energy facts from peer-reviewed sources, government databases, and industry reports, documenting specific metrics such as solar capacity, wind generation, and efficiency rates across different regions and time periods",
    "Step 2: Data scientist receives the compiled renewable energy dataset and performs statistical analysis to calculate averages for key metrics including mean capacity factors, average generation output, and typical efficiency percentages across all collected data points",
    "Step 3: Both team members validate results by cross-referencing calculated averages against original source data, documenting methodology, assumptions, and confidence intervals, then prepare a joint summary report presenting findings with visualizations"
