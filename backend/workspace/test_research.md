"Globally, costs of fully installed battery storage projects declined by 93% between 2010 and 2024, from USD 2,571/kWh to USD 192/kWh. Additionally, battery storage costs in 2024 decreased by 38% for a 2-hours system and 32% percent for a 4-hours system compared to 2023"[8].

**Shift to Lithium Iron Phosphate Chemistry**

Within the lithium-ion sector, a significant shift toward more cost-effective and durable chemistries occurred. "Within the lithium-ion sector, a shift towards lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistries has been taking place, particularly in utility-scale deployments. LFP's market share has grown from 48% in 2021 to an estimated 85% by 2024, driven by their lower costs, higher cycle life, and better security"[8].

**Emerging Battery Technologies**

Beyond lithium-ion, alternative battery technologies made significant progress in 2024. "In 2024, Swedish company Altris AB achieved a milestone with a sodium-ion battery cell with more than 160 Wh/kg energy density, making it commercially viable for energy storage applications"[9]. Additionally, "CATL, the world's largest EV battery maker, made significant progress in solid-state batteries in 2024. The company has entered trial production of 20 amp-hour (Ah) solid-state cells, achieving an energy density of 500 Wh/kg—a 40% improvement over existing lithium-ion batteries"[9].

## Conclusion

The three dominant renewable energy trends in 2024—solar energy dominance, energy storage advancement, and record global investment—demonstrate that the world is undergoing a fundamental transformation in its energy systems. Solar energy's 81% share of new renewable capacity additions, combined with record battery storage deployments and unprecedented global investment, signals that renewable energy has transitioned from an emerging technology to the primary driver of global energy expansion.

However, despite these record achievements, the world faces a critical challenge. "Yet a growth rate of at least 16.6% must be maintained to reach targets of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030"[12]. The energy transition is accelerating, but the pace must continue to increase to meet climate goals and the 2030 renewable energy targets.
